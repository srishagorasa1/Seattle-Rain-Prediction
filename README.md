# Seattle-Rain-Prediction

Climate prediction is crucial for federal and local governments, farmers, and tourist agencies in order to plan well in advance for any decision-making or get ready for any likely weather/climate extremes. Many factors are contributing to climate prediction. In this project, I selected my city, Seattle, where many people (outside WA state) think "it's always rainy in Seattle".

In part 1 (predicting seattle rain, part 1.ipynb), I investigated the accuracy of predicting rain for a day that is months in the future, if we know the maximum and minimum temperature in previous years. I used various data analysis and a variety of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and I then tuned MLAs' hyper-parameters to determine the highest accuracy score, which was 68%.

In part 2 (Predicting Seattle Rain, Part 2.ipynb), I utilized a novel feature engineering to extract new variables that are highly correlated with rain. This, along with tuning hyper-parameters led to an accuracy score of 83%.

In part 3 (Precipitation Amount Forecast (Part 3).ipynb), it is seen that precipitation and temperature are inversely associated and daily climatological temperature can be used as a predictor for daily climatological precipitation via linear regression.

This project was initiated from Kaggle dataset and question. I detected a mistake by many users and provided a unique feature engineering to improve rain prediction. I also extend the project to predict precipitation amount.

In the future, I will use additional features (variables such as wind, pressure, El Nino index, Atmospheric River index, and so on), use data for a longer time range, and employ more feature engineering to improve the prediction.
